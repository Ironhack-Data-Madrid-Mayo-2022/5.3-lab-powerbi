## Introduction

[Power BI](https://www.tableau.com/) as Tableau is a data visualization tool which provides pictorial and graphical representations of data.

Your goal in this lab is to create a **Power BI dashboard** that shows the insights you find useful from de given data.

## Your `data`
In the `data` folder you will find the following files:

**1. classicmodels.sql** : the classicmodels database (you can import it directly if you are using tableau desktop)

**2. ERD.png** : the ERD of the classicmodels database

**3. .xlsx file** : This excel file contains the data displayed in several sheets inside the file. You'll have to build the relationships between tables on your own.

## Getting Started

#### Challenge 1
Open Power BI in your laptop and import the data.

Create at least **`5 different figures`** explaining different insights, pay attention to the details, choose the proper figures and/or tables, build the figures coherently with each other (example: if china is red in a graph it shoul be associated to red everywhere).

#### Challenge 2 
Create a **`dashboard`** where you structure the info in the sheets in a way that everything make sense, it's easily readable and self explanatory. It must have at least two pages.


## Deliverables

Export the dashboard to a .pbix file and upload it to your Github repository.

:fire: **In case Github canÂ´t handle your huge dashboard...** :fire:
Export your dashboard to pdf or screenshot each page and paste it in a Power Point presentation.

Add this file to your repository.

## Submission

Add your deliverables to git. Then commit, add and push your branch to the remote.
